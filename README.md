# AntSimulation

This is an ant simulation that contains the below ant classes. Each class performs an "action" and each action is unique to the class.  For example, a queen will hatch one of the four other ants the first day of each turn (a day is encompassing of 10 turns or "steps"). The simulation can be ran in either "continuous" or "step" mode. Once you start continuous mode, you provide a speed of execution for the simulation, in seconds via a JOPTION frame. The simulation will then begin with each ant performing its action each turn or step. 


There are five types of ants in the simulation:
1. Queen
2. Forager
3. Scout
4. Soldier
5. Bala
